# Minesweeper

It's minesweeper... in Haskell!

Features:
* IO monad completely isolated in UI functions
* Generates and plays a game of Minesweeper
* Automatically reveals fields of 0s like the Windows version

Todo:
* I feel like it could be more "Haskell-y" - the fact that I didn't use any monads beyond IO worries me
* Point-free stuff... how?
